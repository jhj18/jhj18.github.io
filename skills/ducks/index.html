      Our second to last day in Dublin, we took a bus out to a neighboring town called Lucan, where the professor leading the trip grew up. We received a walking tour of the town which was kickstarted with a journey to some castle ruins. And what a journey it was. We may have possibly taken the wrong bus to get to Lucan. It took us in the right direction, but didn’t stop where we thought it would, so we had a bit of a trek to get into the residential part of the town, where we’d be spending most of our day. After our tour, we went out to a small quay along the river, where kids splashed in the water just off the dock. Our professor's - Marie - mom told us that it was increasingly becoming one of Tiernan’s (Marie’s son) favorite places because of the ducks that swim by. We spotted a few ducks of our own and I snapped a picture when they were passing under the bridge that crosses the river.
