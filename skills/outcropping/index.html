      We didnâ€™t have a great start the day we went to explore the Cliffs of Moher. Up at 7a.m., we immediately had to start moving at a much faster pace than I think I ever have in my life. Our apartments were in galway, but they were tucked away on the outskirts of NUI, about a thirty minute walk into the city. And into the city we had to be for our 7:30a.m. bus to the cliffs. When we arrived, we were given the chance to both walk on the cliffs and to take a ferry ride to see them from the water. This photo of these jagged rocks protruding from the water was taken on the ferry. Not featured in the photo (because they were crowded on the other side of the rock), are hundreds of birds, perched on it to get some sun.
