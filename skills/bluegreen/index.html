      We didn’t have a great start the day we went to explore the Cliffs of Moher. Up at 7a.m., we immediately had to start moving at a much faster pace than I think I ever have in my life. Our apartments were in galway, but they were tucked away on the outskirts of NUI, about a thirty minute walk into the city. And into the city we had to be for our 7:30a.m. bus to the cliffs. When we arrived, we were given the choice to take the “easy” route - which had handrails, less of a steep slope, and the most traditional angle for taking pictures - or the “harder” route - which had no barriers, a steeper slope and a more picturesque view of the cliffs and the sea. We decided to take the rougher path.
