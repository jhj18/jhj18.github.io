    <p>
      Barley has to reach 232 degrees celsius in order to reach the burnt state that makes for the best fermented Guinness. “Best.” (I’m not a fan of Guinness, but I’ve met a lot of non-Irish people who are.) On our second day in the city, we took a bus out to the Guinness Storehouse, where you can take a self-guided tour through a small Guinness museum, do a taste-test, enjoy a free pint on the top floor while looking out at the city through the skybar windows, and buy an overpriced pint glass if you feel so inclined. The museum used neon signs as headlines for their informational plaques, and this 232 degrees C sign is one of those.
