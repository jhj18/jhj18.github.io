      When I was a kid, the other kids in the neighborhood used to come over to play jedi/sith with light sabers made from pool noodles. (We tried playing with the store-bought plastic ones, but that resulted in too many injuries.) Now there's rust on the fence around the backyard. I haven't heard a battle cry in years.
