      Whilst in Ireland on study abroad this past summer, I made it a mission for myself to take a picture of every bike I saw. It wasn't something I had flown in thinking I was going to do, but after I took a snap of my first one, I knew I wouldn't be able to stop. There were a number of them throughout the two-week trip, but the three that are dearest to me are all featured in this collection. Coincidentally, they're all from the western region of Ireland. I spotted this pink bike while riding in a wagon pulled by a horse on Inis Oírr, the most populous of the three small islands off of Ireland's west coast.
