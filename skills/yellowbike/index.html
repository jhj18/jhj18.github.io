      Whilst in Ireland on study abroad this past summer, I made it a mission for myself to take a picture of every bike I saw. It wasn't something I had flown in thinking I was going to do, but after I took a snap of my first one, I knew I wouldn't be able to stop. There were a number of them throughout the two-week trip, but the three that are dearest to me are all featured in this collection. Coincidentally, they're all from the western region of Ireland. While this bike is clearly out of commission, I couldn't resist taking a quick picture while wandering around a small village of shops in Spidéal, an all-Irish-Speaking town just outside of Galway. It was propped up against the colorful yellow exterior of a basket shop.
