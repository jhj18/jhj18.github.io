      When I first went off to Pitt, my mom thought I'd need to be incentivized to go home. Within the first month, she'd planned a trip up to Niagara Falls for my "fall break." I probably would have preferred to actually just <em>go home</em> and see my dog and watch some movies, but I'm all for humoring my mom, and she'd already planned out a whole itinerary, so we went. Niagara Falls makes me anxious, no matter what country I'm in. It's loud and crowded and immensely hot. I found during this particular trip, however, that there are moments of peace and some great photography angles in places that are a little tucked away from the rest of the world.
