      We didnâ€™t have a great start the day we went to explore the Cliffs of Moher. Up at 7a.m., we immediately had to start moving at a much faster pace than I think I ever have in my life. Our apartments were in galway, but they were tucked away on the outskirts of NUI, about a thirty minute walk into the city. And into the city we had to be for our 7:30a.m. bus to the cliffs. On the way back, however, the bus driver stopped periodically along our root to let us off to stretch our legs and take in the scenic coastal views. During one such stop, we stopped by a petrol station where we bought ninety-nines and walked across the street to where we could look out over the water on some large rocks. This photo of someone standing in the distance is one I took of one of the other students on the trip as the looked out at the sea.
