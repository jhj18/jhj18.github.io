      We arrived in Dublin the day after their Pride parade. The streets were still lined with rainbow flags, some even strung up in front of some local government buildings. Ireland was the first country to bring about the legalization of gay marriage through popular vote. In 2017, they held a referendum where they allowed Irish citizens to vote for the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the country, and decided overwhelmingly in favor of those rights (over 70%). The parade has been a big affair ever since.
