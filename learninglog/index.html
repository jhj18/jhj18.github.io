            <tr><td>11:00 a.m./2.13.19</td><td>1:00 p.m./2.13.19</td><td>Formatting the page with html/css</td><td>the html went pretty smoothly for this part. the only thing that i had to look up was how to format columns on the page. i did try to insert a footer, but it hasn't appeared on the page yet, so i may need to revisit the code to see if there's something missing.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2:30 p.m./2.14/19</td><td>8:30 p.m./2.14.19</td><td>inserting pictures onto the page, adding a navigation bar with (currently defunct) links at the top of the page and formatting them to change with different actions</td><td>adding images turned out to be a bigger struggle than anticipated. just the matter of getting the images onto my github pages took nearly three hours to complete. while it's not necessarily something we've talked about in the class, i remember one of my other professors telling us that it's very important that all of your files be located in the same folder if you want to link them, which is something i forgot when it came to uploading images. i had to look up how to add images onto github in order for the images to appear on the page, which is really quite simple. adding the links to the navigation bar was simple enough in theory once i found a tutorial that worked, although i've come to find out both through adding images and the navigation bar that not everything is fitting into the columns i've added to my html. the last photos i've been adding to some rows have dropped down to the row below, as has the final link in my navigation. i may need to look into creating a table to make sure everything fits, although if i want to have independent scrolling pannels, this may be a hinderance. i'm still looking into more options. i also tried to create a collapsing header via a tutorial video, although i came to find that the video was actually teaching you how to collapse a banner (below the header), and adding in the code messed up the formatting of my pictures.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4:00 p.m./2.15.19</td><td>5:00 p.m./2.15.19</td><td>turning images into links</td><td>once i figured out the basic process for this, i found it pretty easy to complete, although i've since discovered that rules i applied to different functions for my navigation links are also now applying to the image links, so i will need to figure out how to make a rule that negates this for the images.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>11:00 p.m./2.18.19</td><td>2:30 p.m./2.18.19</td><td>creating individual pages for photos</td><td>this process went a lot more quickly than designing the homepage did (probably because there were less elements. i formatted the header at the top of the page the same way i had done before, and then all i had to do was add an 'h2' for the title of the photo, insert the photo, add a paragraph beneath the photo, and make sure they were all aligned and the same width. that being said, because i had 23 individual pages, this took some time. i didn't actually write the paragraphs today, but i will later this week.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2:30 p.m./2.19.19</td><td>6:00 p.m./2.19.19</td><td>html table and fixing footer</td><td>i tried making the html table to contain my photos today, and it did keep all the photos in what are essentially four columns, but there are awkward gaps between the photos because they aren't all the same size, which is frustrating. i finally managed to get my footer all onto one line by making sure that all the margins and padding were at 0px. i tried to do the same with the navigation bar i created at the top last week, but now the nav bar has disappeared. i think it may be behind the top banner.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>11:00 a.m./2.20.19</td><td>12:00 p.m./2.20.19</td><td>6:00 p.m./2.19.19</td><td>begin writing paragraphs fro individual pages</td>i began writing the paragraphs that will give backstories to individual photos.</tr>
            <tr><td>2:30 p.m./2.21.19</td><td>11:30 p.m./2.21.19</td><td>hover text; practice run of using 'box' element to contain photos on homepage; img effects</td><td>i looked up how to make banners of text appear over photos and in doing so found a way to display my photos in a grid similar to what i'd been trying to do (although not entirely the same). not wanting to alter the work i'd already done - which was presentable - i created a test page to try out the tutorial and play around with it to adjust it to my own liking. when i discovered this worked, i copy-and-pasted everything into my main page of html for this skills assignment. i then created all of the banners of text as the tutorial instructed, although the shaded backgrounds did not appear, so some of the text is hard to see. i tried to add a little shading to the text to make the letters stand out more. i think it helped to some extent. i also followed along with a tutorial that showed me how to make the images zoom in just a little bit while hovering over them, which seemed complicated at first but was actually pretty complicated. i also re-linked all of my photos on the homepage.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>12:30 a.m./2.22.19</td><td>5:30 a.m./2.22.19</td><td>more writing for individual pages</td><td>i wrote more paragraphs for individual pages.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6:00 p.m./2.22.29</td><td>9:00 p.m/2.22.19</td><td>finished writing paragraphs</td><td>i wrote the last of the paragraphs for my individual pages.</td></tr>
