            <tr><td>11:00 a.m./2.13.19</td><td>1:00 p.m./2.13.19</td><td>Formatting the page with html/css</td><td>the html went pretty smoothly for this part. the only thing that i had to look up was how to format columns on the page. i did try to insert a footer, but it hasn't appeared on the page yet, so i may need to revisit the code to see if there's something missing.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2:30 p.m./2.14/19</td><td>8:30 p.m./2.14.19</td><td>inserting pictures onto the page, adding a navigation bar with (currently defunct) links at the top of the page and formatting them to change with different actions</td><td>adding images turned out to be a bigger struggle than anticipated. just the matter of getting the images onto my github pages took nearly three hours to complete. while it's not necessarily something we've talked about in the class, i remember one of my other professors telling us that it's very important that all of your files be located in the same folder if you want to link them, which is something i forgot when it came to uploading images. i had to look up how to add images onto github in order for the images to appear on the page, which is really quite simple. adding the links to the navigation bar was simple enough in theory once i found a tutorial that worked, although i've come to find out both through adding images and the navigation bar that not everything is fitting into the columns i've added to my html. the last photos i've been adding to some rows have dropped down to the row below, as has the final link in my navigation. i may need to look into creating a table to make sure everything fits, although if i want to have independent scrolling pannels, this may be a hinderance. i'm still looking into more options. i also tried to create a collapsing header via a tutorial video, although i came to find that the video was actually teaching you how to collapse a banner (below the header), and adding in the code messed up the formatting of my pictures.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4:00 p.m./2.15.19</td><td>5:00 p.m./2.15.19</td><td>turning images into links</td><td>once i figured out the basic process for this, i found it pretty easy to complete, although i've since discovered that rules i applied to different functions for my navigation links are also now applying to the image links, so i will need to figure out how to make a rule that negates this for the images.</td></tr>
